# Text-to-Image Generation with Stable Diffusion

This project demonstrates how to use the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model to generate images from text prompts. The Stable Diffusion model, provided by the `diffusers` library from Hugging Face, is a powerful tool for creating high-quality images based on textual descriptions.

## Installation

To run this program, you'll need Python 3.7+ and a few Python libraries. You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install torch diffusers transformers pillow matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Suyash-Gaurav/Image-Generation-with-Pre-trained-models-.git
   cd text-to-image-stable-diffusion
   ```

2. **Run the Script:**

   You can use the provided script to generate an image from a text prompt.

   ```python
   import torch
   from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   # Load the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model
   model_id = "CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4"
   device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"

   pipeline = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id)
   pipeline = pipeline.to(device)

   # Define your text prompt
   text_prompt = "A serene landscape with a mountain in the background, a river flowing through a dense forest, and a clear blue sky."

   # Generate the image
   with torch.no_grad():
       output = pipeline([text_prompt], guidance_scale=7.5)

   # Extract the generated image
   image = output.images[0]

   # Save the generated image
   image.save("generated_image.png")

   # Display the generated image using matplotlib
   plt.imshow(image)
   plt.axis('off')  # Turn off axis
   plt.show()
   ```

3. **Modify the Text Prompt:**

   You can change the `text_prompt` variable to generate different images. For example:

   ```python
   text_prompt = "A futuristic cityscape at sunset with flying cars and skyscrapers."
   ```

## Example

Here is an example of generating an image from a text prompt:

```python
import torch
from diffusers import StableDiffusionPipeline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model
model_id = "CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4"
device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"

pipeline = StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_id)
pipeline = pipeline.to(device)

# Define your text prompt
text_prompt = "A serene landscape with a mountain in the background, a river flowing through a dense forest, and a clear blue sky."

# Generate the image
with torch.no_grad():
    output = pipeline([text_prompt], guidance_scale=7.5)

# Extract the generated image
image = output.images[0]

# Save the generated image
image.save("generated_image.png")

# Display the generated image using matplotlib
plt.imshow(image)
plt.axis('off')  # Turn off axis
plt.show()
```
